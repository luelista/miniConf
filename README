R E A D M E  for miniConf

First developed in C# / .NET 3.5 for debugging purposes of a MUC server,
miniConf advanced to a minimalistic, but reliable client for XMPP 
multi-user conferences (MUC).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which MUC servers are supported?

You can use miniConf to connect to any standards-compliant Jabber server
and from there, to any XEP-0045 [1] compliant MUC component. But I use
it mostly with the Prosody[2] server and my own MUC component[3] I'm
developing in node-js.
